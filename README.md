## Introduction
Fake news detection is a crucial task to combat misinformation and ensure access to authentic information. This project demonstrates a machine learning-based approach to classify news articles into real or fake categories.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy (Data processing)
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
- NLTK/Spacy (Text Preprocessing)
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (Visualization)

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains labeled news articles. It includes features like headlines, content, and labels (real/fake).

**Note:** Please ensure you have the dataset downloaded locally or access it via the link provided in the notebook.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading and Exploration**:
   - Load the dataset and explore its structure.
   - Check for missing or inconsistent data.

2. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - Tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.
   - Removal of stop words and punctuation.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Transform text data into numerical format using methods like TF-IDF.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - Train various machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.).
   - Evaluate the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. **Visualization**:
   - Display important insights through visualizations.

6. **Prediction**:
   - Use the trained model to predict new instances.

## Results
The implemented models achieve promising accuracy in classifying news articles. The notebook contains detailed evaluation metrics and plots.
